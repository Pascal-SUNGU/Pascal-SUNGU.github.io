Since 2023, I began contributing to a project evaluating the impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on malaria transmission in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

We are using Bayesian models to assess product efficacy and forecast long-term public health outcomes. Insights from this work could help improve vector control strategies in sub-Saharan Africa.

More updates to come as the project progresses.
