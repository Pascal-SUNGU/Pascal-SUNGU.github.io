I am involved in various research projects related to **data science**, **infectious disease modeling**, and **public health**.

### Current Focus

- Modeling malaria transmission and intervention impact
- Statistical inference using Bayesian methods
- Field evaluations of vector control tools

### Selected Projects

#### ðŸ§® Malaria Modeling in DRC (PhD Project, 2023â€“)
**Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Lasting IRS for Malaria Control in DRC  
A hierarchical Bayesian model was developed to analyze the residual efficacy of indoor residual spraying (IRS) products across various ecological contexts in Africa. These outputs feed into a dynamic transmission model calibrated to DRC-specific epidemiological and environmental parameters. The goal is to optimize IRS deployment strategies and inform national malaria control policy.

#### ðŸ§  Deep Learning in Cybersecurity (2021)
**Title:** A Mathematical Modeling Approach in Cybersecurity using Deep Neural Learning  
**Institution:** Pan African University Institute for Science and Technology (PAUSTI)  
A SEIARS compartmental model was developed to simulate the spread of malicious cyber threats, inspired by biological infection dynamics. The system of differential equations governing the model was solved using a deep neural network with one hidden layer, offering a compact and efficient alternative to classical finite difference methods. The BFGS optimization method showed strong performance in achieving convergence and accuracy.

### ðŸ§® Formal Concept Analysis for Image Characterization (2018)
**Title:** Concept Lattice Theory in Data Mining and its Applications
**Institution:** African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon  
This essay applied formal concept analysis (FCA), a method from lattice theory, to uncover patterns in tabular datasets. The work demonstrated how concept lattices can support knowledge discovery in databases and how they can be extended to characterize image datasets using landmark-based descriptors.

#### ðŸ’¼ Technical Consultant at BigBang ERP (2022)
**Role:** Functional & Technical Consultant for NetSuite solutions  
Involved in implementation, customization, and client support for ERP systems using NetSuite. Contributed to digital transformation projects in various sectors.
