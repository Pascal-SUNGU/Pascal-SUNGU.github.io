#### Hello, Iâ€™m Pascal SUNGU

I'm a mathematical modeler working at the intersection of malaria transmission modeling, applied mathematics, and digital tools for public health impact in Africa.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics to Life Sciences at the University of Douala (Cameroon), and Iâ€™m affiliated with various research and training programs related to infectious disease modeling, including malaria, IRS, and ITN evaluations.

##### ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

- Malaria transmission modeling (IRS, ITNs)
- Bayesian statistics and computational epidemiology
- Public health impact evaluation using simulation models
- Mathematical modeling of cybersecurity threats

##### ðŸ§­ Career Snapshot

- PhD researcher in malaria transmission modeling
- Former ERP Consultant (NetSuite, Celigo)
- Lecturer in applied mathematics and computer science
- Contributor to several academic and health research initiatives across Africa
